# ECSE3038 Lab 3
## Aim
This lab was designed to have students more accustomed to the technologies used in designing and implementing a Restful API server.
## Requirements
The specifications have shifted slightly since the last developer meeting. Your client's budget recently increased and now they're able to pat for a database service. You've done your research and found that MongoDB is the most suitable database platform for the project. With this new information, the client has asked that you modify the API server to store all Tank related data to be stored in the database.
The following routes should be modified to support the use of the mongodb database:
 - GET/data
 - POST /data
 - PATCH /data/ :id
 - DELETE /data/ :id
